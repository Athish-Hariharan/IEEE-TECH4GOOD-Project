# IEEE-TECH4GOOD-Project
The IEEE Tech4Good Project focuses on building a wildlife detection system in Wayanad's forests. The system will monitor and provide alerts based on the wildlife detected. 
It primarily utilizes a custom-trained YOLO model with different processing algorithms for acquiring the IR Camera input to work efficiently in both day and night.
